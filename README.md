Echo state networks for power system state estimation considering two scenarios: normal operation and sudden load change.

The data and its description for both scenarios can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wKpF2FwFHSne97nx7XcSvXXCvuPmQ1g5?usp=sharing).

This repository contains part of the code of the article _Data Driven State Estimation for Power Systems using Echo State Networks_ submitted (waiting for acceptance/rejection notification) to IEEE SmartGridComm Conference 2021.
